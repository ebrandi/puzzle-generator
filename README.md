## 🌐 Deployment Options

### 📱 Local Development (Default)
Perfect for development, testing, or personal use:
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- No SSL certificate needed
- Firewall allows development port (3000)
- Quick setup and easy debugging

### 🌍 Public Deployment with SSL
Professional deployment ready for production:
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Professional web server configuration
- **SSL Certificate**: Free Let's Encrypt certificate with auto-renewal
- **Secure Firewall**: Only ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) exposed
- **HTTPS Redirect**: Automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: Enhanced security with modern web standards

#### Prerequisites for Public Deployment:
- Domain name pointing to your server's IP address
- Valid email address for SSL certificate notifications
- Server accessible from the internet on ports 80 and 443

#### DNS Setup:
Before running the deployment script for public installation, ensure your domain's DNS A record points to your server:

```bash
# Check if your domain resolves correctly (replace with your domain)
nslookup yourdomain.com

# The result should show your server's public IP address
```

## 🛠️ Application Management

The Ebrandi Puzzle Generator runs as a systemd service for reliable operation and easy management:

### 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Installation Location**: `/opt/puzzle-generator`
- **Dedicated User**: `puzzle-generator` (system user, no login shell)
- **Service Management**: systemd service (`ebrandi-puzzle.service`)
- **Process Isolation**: Runs as dedicated user with security restrictions
- **Auto-Start**: Enabled to start automatically on system boot
- **Logging**: Centralized through systemd journal

### 🔧 Service Management Commands

#### Quick Management Script
Use the included management script for easy service control:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd /opt/puzzle-generator

# Check service status
./manage.sh status

# Start the service
./manage.sh start

# Stop the service
./manage.sh stop

# Restart the service
./manage.sh restart

# View real-time logs
./manage.sh logs

# View recent logs
./manage.sh recent

# Enable auto-start on boot
./manage.sh enable

# Disable auto-start on boot
./manage.sh disable
```

#### Direct systemctl Commands
You can also use systemctl commands directly:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ebrandi-puzzle

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start ebrandi-puzzle

# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop ebrandi-puzzle

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart ebrandi-puzzle

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable ebrandi-puzzle

# Disable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl disable ebrandi-puzzle

# View service logs (real-time)
sudo journalctl -u ebrandi-puzzle -f

# View recent service logs
sudo journalctl -u ebrandi-puzzle -n 50
```

## 🛡️ Server Management (Public Deployment)

If you deployed using the public deployment option with nginx and SSL, here are additional management commands:

### 🔒 SSL Certificate Management

```bash
# Check certificate status
sudo certbot certificates

# Manually renew certificates (done automatically by cron job)
sudo certbot renew

# Test automatic renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# View certificate expiration dates
sudo certbot certificates
```

### 🌐 Nginx Management

```bash
# Check nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Reload nginx configuration (without dropping connections)
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# Test nginx configuration for syntax errors
sudo nginx -t

# View nginx access logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# View nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

### 🛡️ Firewall Management

```bash
# Check current firewall status
sudo ufw status

# View detailed firewall rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Temporarily disable firewall (not recommended for production)
sudo ufw disable

# Re-enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Add new port (if needed)
sudo ufw allow [port]/tcp
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Public Deployment

#### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# If certificate generation failed
sudo certbot delete --cert-name yourdomain.com
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com

# Check certificate chain
echo | openssl s_client -servername yourdomain.com -connect yourdomain.com:443 | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```

#### Nginx Issues
```bash
# Check nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reset nginx to default (if needed)
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/puzzle-generator
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# View specific error details
journalctl -u nginx.service
```

#### Domain/DNS Issues
```bash
# Check if domain resolves to your server
nslookup yourdomain.com

# Check if ports are accessible
telnet yourdomain.com 80
telnet yourdomain.com 443
```

### 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Check SSL certificate status and logs
2. **Monthly**: Review nginx logs for any issues
3. **Quarterly**: Update system packages and restart services

```bash
# System updates (run regularly)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Restart services after updates
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Log Rotation

Nginx logs are automatically rotated by the system, but you can manually manage them:

```bash
# Check log file sizes
sudo du -h /var/log/nginx/

# Manually rotate logs (if needed)
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```
